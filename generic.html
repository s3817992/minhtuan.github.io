									<h1>My IT<br />
									Project</h1>
									<p>For my IT project, I want to create a software which have an incredibly huge practical benefits , this software will be able to analyze ,diagnose and produce a balance diet and counter measurement for people who have certain medical issues in general and in particular such as gout, diabetes, or obesity. The app name is Ultimedic,it will be available on both platform, iOS and Android, another version for pc will be developed if the software is widely accepted by everyone.There will be a free version for the public and a paid one for people who are looking for a more exclusive experience
									</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/pic10.jpeg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>The number of people with diabetes has risen from 108 million in 1980 to 422 million in 2014, gout is now the most common type of inflammatory arthropathy in adults around the world, worldwide obesity has nearly triple since 1975. With these statistics, it is impossible to sit down and let it pass by. My dad recently was diagnosed with gout, my uncle and other relatives also had gout and diabetes in their medical history and there were very few apps that could provide them with the health care they needed. These were the motivations for me to create Ultimedic.</p>
								<p>Ultimedic aims to reduce the common diseases which have been named. The app is free to download on Apple Store and Google Play Store, when first started it will ask for new users to create an account and provide the software with personal information such as name, age, email, address. This information will be stored in the database and will be encrypted for better security and to protect the privacy of the customers. When signed in successfully, it will show up a tab asking for heights, weights, medical history, symptoms (if any), an algorithm will then determined base on the given information by the users the current diseases or potential one, for example “people’s whose height is 160 and weight 70kg, have a higher chance of being obese” or “swelling and pain in joint cause be the causes of gout”. It will then be given counter measurement to ensure that you won’t cross paths  with these illnesses Ultimedic will ask for your permission to access the device’s location, hence tracking your movement and position. Let’s say that you are suffering from gout, the system will automatically detect the nearest medical center as well as providing the address, opening and closing hours, phone number. As well as coming up with a diet menu for the week, preventing food that causes the illnesses to be more severe, pushing food that can provide more nutrients while keeping the patient full. Moreover, it will alert users with their medication, so they won’t forget because this is a very common problem for everyone. Another feature is call “Health Hazard”, this feature based on the location broadcast by your device to the app, if you are entering a restaurant or a store that has a history of causing health hazard and food poisoning, Ultimedic will warn you about it for your pre caution. These are just basic function for the free package, if users want to upgrade to the premium package, the upgrade function is in account settings. The only payment method is by credit card via PayPal or visa. The premium package is for people who wants a more privilege experience, with it Ultimedic will provide you with a more detailed diet, as well as a 24/7 hotline to your own personal healthcare companion provided by prestigious clinics and hospitals. Ultimedic strives to be a user-friendly application, the layout for the app is simple yet very modern, everything is very straight forwarded, the aim is to help old people and young adults to be able to use the app with ease. Finally, there is a “Relative” function where family members can create a group and connect their account with each other. This makes the process of tracking easier, especially for families with young kids and elderlies. The first step is only the common diseases, I want to make this app as accurate as possible before moving on the big ones like cancer, HIV, AIDS, those will take a bit longer time to do research.</p>
								<p>Ultimedic does not requires high technology to develop at all. I need to have a Mac OS computer to develop application that can run on iOS, this is my drawback since I do not use any of Apple’s product. There should also be a pre-installed version of XCode in it and iOS devices to test out the function. On android, everything is easier, you only need a windows laptop and installed Android SDK, as well as Apache Ant- tool that makes the building process automatically and Gradle- An advanced building that allows me to define custom build logic.</p>
								<p>I think I need to have more knowledge in other programing languages since I am developing software on both platforms. Luckily, this will also beneficial my ideal job. As I said above, to work for Samsung I need to learn more languages like Java, C++,etc. Moreover, getting familiar and doing a deeper research on both android and iOS can be a bigger advantage for me in the recruitment process and for the project as well. I will be needing some iOS devices since I don’t have any in hands, but the iMacs at RMIT will be very helpful. Lastly programming AI with deep learning to make the diagnosis faster.</p>
								<p>If Ultimedic turns out to be a huge successful, then I will start to develop a version for windows which comes with more feature as well expanding the network to other countries and building up bigger servers, placing them across the region. The aim is to improve and provide health care to everyone and to reduce the statistics of illnesses around the globe, it will take some time for the app to be smoothly and accurate. I think Ultimedic will draw attention to the health care area where IT experts are missing out lots of opportunities for success and to give people a healthier life. </p>
